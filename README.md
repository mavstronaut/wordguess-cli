# wordguess-cli

This game is built on node and runs from the CLI. In order to run it, download this repo and use ` npm i` to install dependencies from the package.json. 

Once the game is run, it requires a theme of questions in order to select the possible entries in the game for you to guess. Then simply use the keyboard to enter in those guesses following basic hangman rules. 5 wrong guesses are allowed, so good luck!
